# NativeTwitterLogin
recently i was trying to add native twitter login using fabric but i could find will documented post about how to make it so i wanted to share the experience i had to add native android library and then bind to them using '[Binding a Java Library](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/advanced_topics/binding-a-java-library/ "Binding a Java Library")'
first of all we have to download android studio and then download fabric library to get out unique fabric id

to do this step you can directly find useful link in [fabric documentation ](https://docs.fabric.io/android/fabric/settings/api-keys.html "fabric documentation ")

After doing this step we have to[ download the jar of fabric library and twitter core ](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fabric.TwitterCore " download the jar of fabric library and twitter core ")so we can convert them to dll and then bind them to us them in xamarin 

finally we have twitter native login direct you to twitter app
